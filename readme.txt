NICE Version 1.0 README 

NICE allows you to run a program in a different priority. Using OS/2's DETACH
command, you can throw a program into background in either idle or time-
critical priority.

Based on vague memories of the command with the same name under Unix.

Invoke NICE without options to see the usage instructions.

NICE is a 32-bit application. It requires OS/2 2.0
